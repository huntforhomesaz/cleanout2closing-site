  - question: "How long does probate usually take in Arizona and Pima County?"
    answer: >
      Every case is different, but many informal probates in Arizona take around
      six to eight months from opening the estate to closing it, assuming there
      are no major disputes or complications. Formal or supervised probates can
      take longer. The sale of the house often happens while the probate is
      still open, as part of the overall administration timeline.
    audience: "heir"
    schema: true
  - question: "Can the house be sold before probate is finished?"
    answer: >
      Often yes. In many Arizona estates, once a personal representative has
      been appointed and there are no restrictions from the court, the house
      can be prepared, listed, and sold while the probate is still open. In
      supervised or contested cases, the court may have to approve or confirm
      the sale. You should always follow your attorney's guidance on timing.

    schema: true
  - question: "Do all sales of real estate in probate need court approval?"
    answer: >
      Not always. In many informal, unsupervised probates, the personal
      representative has authority under Arizona law to sell estate real
      property without a separate court order, as long as it is consistent with
      their duties and any restrictions in the will or court orders. In
      supervised probates, sales of real property are generally subject to
      court confirmation. Your attorney can tell you which applies to your
      case.

  - question: "Where is probate for a Tucson or Pima County property handled?"
    answer: >
      Probate for someone who lived in Pima County is typically filed in the
      Pima County Superior Court. The court oversees the legal process, while
      the personal representative handles day-to-day administration of the
      estate, including managing and selling property under the court's
      rules and any orders that apply.

      No. This guide is for general information only. It is not legal, tax, or
      financial advice. Every estate is different. You should speak with an
      Arizona probate attorney or fiduciary about your specific situation. My
      role is to help coordinate the property, vendors, and sale alongside your

# Pima County probate property sale timeline (plain English)

If you are dealing with an inherited house in Tucson or elsewhere in Pima County, you might be hearing a lot of mixed messages about probate.

Some people say â€œyou cannot do anything until probate is done.â€ Others say â€œjust sell the house and sort it out later.â€ The truth sits in the middle, and it depends on the type of probate and what the court has ordered.

This guide walks through a typical Pima County probate timeline and shows where the **sale of the house** usually fits. It is written in plain English and focuses on the property side, not the legal technicalities.

I am not an attorney. I am a Tucson Realtor and estate transition concierge. I coordinate the property, cleanout, vendors, and sale alongside your attorney or fiduciary, who handles the legal file.

---

## Quick answer if you just need the rough timeline

Every estate is different, but here is a common pattern for an **informal probate** with a house in Pima County:

- Roughly weeks 1â€“8:  
  Attorney files to open the estate and have a personal representative appointed. The personal representative starts gathering information and securing the property.

- Months 2â€“6 (minimum four months for creditor claims):  
  Notice to creditors runs. The personal representative gathers assets, deals with basic bills, and often **prepares and sells the house** during this window.

- Months 5â€“8+:  
  Debts and expenses are paid. Any remaining property issues are resolved. Once everything is in order, the estate can be wrapped up and closed.

Formal or supervised probates, or cases with disputes, can take longer. The sale of the house often happens **while the probate is still open**, not only at the very end.

Your attorney or fiduciary is the one who can tell you how these general stages apply to your specific case.

---

## When this guide is (and is not) for you

**This guide is for you if:**

- The person who passed away lived in Pima County or owned a home in Tucson or nearby.  
- There is, or likely will be, a probate case in Pima County Superior Court.  
- You want to understand where the sale of the house usually fits into the process.  
- You need practical, non-scary language and a way to connect the legal steps to real estate decisions.

**This guide is not the right place to:**

- Get legal advice about whether probate is required.  
- Decide who should be personal representative or how disputes are resolved.  
- Figure out tax treatment of inherited property or capital gains.

For those questions, you always want to talk with an Arizona probate attorney, fiduciary, or tax professional. This guide helps you tie their advice to the **property and sale** side.

---

## Step 1 â€“ Opening the estate and appointing a personal representative

The probate process begins when someone files papers to open the estate in Pima County Superior Court. In most families, this is done with help from a probate attorney.

Early tasks usually include:

- Filing the will, if there is one, with the court.  
- Filing an application or petition to start probate.  
- Asking the court to appoint a **personal representative** (sometimes called an executor).

The personal representative is the person the court authorizes to manage the estateâ€™s affairs. Once they are formally appointed, they have duties and powers under Arizona law, which generally include taking control of estate assets, including real estate, and managing them responsibly.

From the property side, nothing major should happen with the house until there is clarity on **who** is in charge and whether the court has placed any special conditions on them.

---

## Step 2 â€“ Securing and evaluating the Pima County property

Once a personal representative is appointed, securing and evaluating the property is usually near the top of the list.

Common early actions:

- Confirming who has keys or access.  
- Changing locks if needed and appropriate.  
- Doing a basic walk-through to look for water damage, leaks, or safety problems.  
- Making sure insurance and basic utilities are handled so the house does not deteriorate.

At this stage, the focus is on **protecting the property**, not making big decisions yet. But it is also the best time to start thinking about what kind of work may be needed to get the house ready for sale, especially in Tucsonâ€™s climate.

If you are out of state or very busy, this is often where I step in on the property side: walking the house, taking photos and videos, and giving the personal representative and attorney a clear picture of what they are dealing with.

---

## Step 3 â€“ Notifying creditors and letting the claim period run

Once the estate is open and a personal representative is appointed, Arizona law typically requires that creditors be notified and given time to file claims.

In many estates this looks like:

- The personal representative or attorney publishes a notice to creditors in an appropriate publication.  
- Known creditors may also receive direct notice.  
- Creditors generally have a set claim period (currently measured in months, not weeks) to come forward and assert claims.

During this creditor window, **the estate is still active**. The personal representative is handling bills, gathering information, and starting to make practical decisions about assets like the house.

The house does not have to sit untouched during this time. In many cases, the property can be:

- Cleaned out and stabilized.  
- Evaluated for repairs.  
- Listed and even sold, as long as it fits within the legal structure and the personal representativeâ€™s duties.

Your attorney will tell you what is allowed and what timing makes sense in your specific case.

---

## Step 4 â€“ Deciding how and when to sell the house

Once the estate is open and the personal representative understands the property, the next question is **how** the house will be sold and **when** to begin.

Key decisions include:

- Selling **as-is** versus doing some clean up and repairs.  
- Whether a quick sale to an investor makes sense, or a traditional sale is better.  
- How the sale timeline fits with court dates, creditor deadlines, and family needs.

In many Arizona estates, an **informal, unsupervised probate** lets the personal representative sell real estate without a separate court order as long as they act in the estateâ€™s best interest and follow any restrictions in the will or court documents.

In a **supervised or more closely watched probate**, the court may require that the sale of real property be confirmed or approved. That can affect timing and the structure of the purchase contract.

Your attorney is the one who can tell you whether you are in a supervised or unsupervised case and what conditions apply to a sale. My role is to shape the pricing and marketing plan for the Tucson market around those realities.

---

## Step 5 â€“ Preparing the house for sale during probate

For most Pima County homes, there is at least some work to do before listing.

Typical steps:

- Sorting and removing personal belongings and paperwork.  
- Deciding on donation, estate sale, consignment, or haul-away for what remains.  
- Doing basic cleaning and yard work.  
- Addressing safety issues and obvious repairs that would scare away reasonable buyers.

The personal representative can use estate funds to pay for necessary expenses that help preserve or realize value, including appropriate property maintenance and sale-related costs, as long as those expenses are consistent with their duties and the estateâ€™s needs.

In Tucson and surrounding communities, the mix is often:

- **Cleanout and trash removal** for the heavy lifting.  
- **A simple spruce-up** rather than a full remodel.  
- **Local pricing knowledge** to avoid over-improving a home for the neighborhood.

This work usually happens while probate is open and while the creditor period is running, not after everything is finished.

---

## Step 6 â€“ Listing the property and accepting an offer

Once everyone agrees the house is ready, the personal representative, with their attorneyâ€™s guidance, can move ahead with listing.

From the property side, this means:

- Setting a target price based on recent comparable sales in that part of Tucson or Pima County.  
- Listing the property on the MLS as an estate or probate sale, with clear disclosures.  
- Managing showings and feedback.  
- Reviewing offers, including any requested concessions.

In an informal, unsupervised probate without special restrictions, the personal representative will typically be able to accept an offer and sign a purchase contract on behalf of the estate, as long as it is consistent with their duties and any court orders.

In supervised or contested cases, your attorney may require:

- A court-approved format for the contract.  
- A motion asking the court to confirm the sale.  
- A hearing where the court reviews the offer and any objections.

Those legal steps sit in your attorneyâ€™s lane. My work is to keep the buyer-side logistics, inspections, and timelines coordinated so the sale can close smoothly once it is approved.

---

## Step 7 â€“ Closing the sale and holding the proceeds in the estate

When the sale closes:

- The buyer takes title to the property.  
- Liens like mortgages are paid off at closing.  
- Remaining net proceeds go into an estate account, not directly to heirs (unless your attorney has structured it otherwise).

At this point, the **property part** is mostly done, but the probate case may still be open while:

- Remaining creditor claims are resolved.  
- Final expenses are paid.  
- Any tax filings are handled.  
- A final accounting and plan of distribution are prepared.

The house has been turned into cash, but the cash is still under the personal representativeâ€™s control and subject to the court process until the estate is ready to close.

---

## Step 8 â€“ Wrapping up probate and distributing proceeds

The final stages often look like:

- The personal representative and attorney prepare a final accounting.  
- They propose how the remaining assets, including sale proceeds, will be distributed.  
- Interested parties have an opportunity to review and, if needed, object.  
- Once everything is resolved, the court allows the estate to be closed.

Only at this point are the net proceeds from the house fully distributed to heirs, beneficiaries, or others as the will, trust, or state law provides.

From the property perspective, your main work is already complete. The house is sold, and there are no more property taxes, insurance, or maintenance to manage.

## FAQs about the Pima County probate property timeline

### How long does probate usually take?

In many straightforward, informal Arizona estates, probate often takes around six to eight months from opening the estate to closing it. More complex, supervised, or contested cases can take longer. The house often sells somewhere in the middle of that window, not at the very end.

### Can the house be sold before probate is finished?

Often yes. Once there is a personal representative and there are no special restrictions from the court, the house can usually be prepared and sold while the probate is still open, as long as it is consistent with the personal representativeâ€™s duties and your attorneyâ€™s advice.

### Do all sales of real estate in probate need court approval?

No. In many informal, unsupervised probates, the personal representative can sell real estate without a separate court order. In supervised probates or special situations, the court may need to confirm or approve the sale. Your attorney can tell you which you have.

### What if heirs do not agree about selling the house?

Disagreement about a house is common. Your attorney is the one who can advise on legal options when family members disagree. My role is to give everyone clear information about the property, realistic numbers, and what the sale would look like so those legal conversations are based on facts, not guesses.

### Is this legal advice?

No. This guide is general information only. It is not legal, tax, or financial advice. You should always speak with an Arizona probate attorney or fiduciary about your specific situation. I focus on the property, vendors, and sale in coordination with them.
