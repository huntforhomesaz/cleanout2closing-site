# Services to help you move from cleanout to closing

When a home is part of a major life change, it is hard to know what kind of help you even need.  
You just know the house has to be dealt with, and you do not want to manage it alone.

Cleanout2Closing is a Realtor-led estate transition concierge service in Tucson.  
Every service on this page has the same core goal:

- Make the property side simpler.  
- Coordinate the right vendors at the right time.  
- Guide you through a sale that fits your situation and your comfort level.

You do not have to figure out which box you fit in before you reach out.  
This page simply shows the most common ways I help.

## One core service underneath everything

No matter which category you fall into, the foundation is the same:

- Understand your situation, timelines, and decision makers.  
- Walk the property and document what is really needed to get it ready.  
- Build a clear written plan from "where things are today" to "keys handed over at closing."  
- Coordinate vendors and keep the work aligned with your legal and family needs.  
- Represent you as your Tucson Realtor so you have one accountable point of contact.

I do not operate junk trucks, moving crews, or estate sales.  
Instead, I coordinate trusted vendors and trades, keep schedules and documentation straight, and guide the real estate sale from listing through escrow.

Cleanout2Closing does not provide legal, tax, accounting, or fiduciary advice.  
Those decisions stay with you and your attorney, fiduciary, or tax professional.  
My role is to manage the property and sale alongside that advice.

## Service categories

Most families and professionals I help fall into one of these groups.  
Each category has its own needs, but the structure stays the same: listen, plan, coordinate, sell.

### 1. Inherited and probate property: from cleanout to closing

You are dealing with a Tucson home after a death, trust event, or probate.  
There may be a full house of belongings, court timelines, and relatives in different cities.

Good fit if:

- You are an heir, personal representative, or informal "point person" for the property.  
- Probate or trust paperwork is in progress or finished, but the house still feels stuck.  
- You want a clear path from "overwhelming" to "sold," with one property contact.

What I do in this service:

- Coordinate with your attorney or fiduciary on the property side of the plan.  
- Walk the home and help you decide what is kept, donated, sold, or discarded.  
- Line up cleanout, basic repairs, and photos in the right order.  
- List and sell the home as your Realtor, while keeping everyone updated.

### 2. Senior moves and downsizing

A parent or loved one is moving into assisted living, memory care, or a smaller home.  
The house is full, emotions are high, and the timeline often feels tight.

Good fit if:

- You are helping a senior move and do not have the bandwidth to manage the house.  
- You need to coordinate move dates, cleanout, and the sale without chaos.  
- You want someone to focus on the property so you can focus on the person.

What I do in this service:

- Map the move date to a realistic property timeline.  
- Coordinate movers, cleanout vendors, cleaners, and light repairs.  
- Help you decide what has to be done now versus what can wait.  
- Prepare, list, and sell the home in a way that respects privacy and routines.

### 3. Trust and trustee support

You are a trustee, personal representative, or family member with formal responsibilities.  
You need the property handled well and documented clearly.

Good fit if:

- You must be able to show what was done, when, and by whom.  
- The property work needs to align with instructions from an attorney or trust.  
- You want one property contact instead of chasing multiple vendors.

What I do in this service:

- Build a written, property side plan that lines up with your legal guidance.  
- Gather vendor estimates and organize them for easy review and approval.  
- Coordinate scheduled work and keep receipts, photos, and simple summaries together.  
- Represent the property on the market and through escrow, with clear updates.

### 4. Out-of-state owners and heirs

You are responsible for a Tucson property, but you live somewhere else.  
Flying in for every vendor appointment is not realistic.

Good fit if:

- You need a local set of eyes and boots on the ground.  
- You want someone you trust to coordinate vendors and protect access to the home.  
- You still want clear control, without handling every small detail yourself.

What I do in this service:

- Walk the property on your behalf and share photos or video.  
- Coordinate cleanout, repairs, and showings with lockbox and access controls.  
- Keep you updated with simple, scheduled check ins instead of random calls.  
- Guide the sale from pricing through closing, even if you never set foot in Tucson.

### 5. Complex family situations and shared decisions

Sometimes the hardest part is not the property. It is the people.  
Different family members may have different opinions, schedules, and levels of involvement.

Good fit if:

- Several siblings or relatives are involved and decisions are stalling out.  
- You want one neutral property side contact that everyone can talk to.  
- You need information organized so the group can make choices without drama.

What I do in this service:

- Start with a group call when possible so everyone hears the same plan.  
- Provide clear, written updates instead of long, scattered message threads.  
- Help the family see the tradeoffs between different paths for the property.  
- Keep the actual work on track while you work through the decisions you must make together.

### 6. Support for attorneys, fiduciaries, and other professionals

Cleanout2Closing is the consumer-facing side of my work.  
If you are an attorney, fiduciary, or professional who handles estates, you may want a bit more structure and documentation than a typical family.

Good fit if:

- You want one organized point of contact on the property side in Tucson.  
- You need estimates, invoices, and status updates that fit neatly into your files.  
- You want a Realtor who understands fiduciary safeguards and documentation.

What I do in this service:

- Coordinate property walkthroughs, vendor access, and photos.  
- Structure updates, invoices, and receipts so they support your records.  
- Work within your instructions and the boundaries of your engagement.  
- Provide a calm, professional experience for your clients.

For deeper, professional level detail, you can also review my attorney and fiduciary focused site at AZ Probate Concierge.

## What is included with every service

No matter which category you are in, you can expect:

- One primary point of contact for the property and sale.  
- A clear, written plan that ties cleanout, vendors, and the sale together.  
- Vendor coordination, with you approving estimates before work is scheduled.  
- Organized documentation of estimates, invoices, receipts, and key approvals.  
- Real estate representation in Tucson through listing, negotiation, and escrow.  
- Communication that fits you: calls, email, texts, or a mix, with agreed rhythms.

Behind the scenes, I am coordinating a lot of moving pieces.  
From your side, it should feel like one steady, predictable process.

---

## What is not included (and who handles it instead)

To protect you and the professionals around you, some work always sits outside my role.

Not included in Cleanout2Closing services:

- Legal advice, probate filings, or court representation.  
- Tax planning, capital gains advice, or bookkeeping.  
- Formal fiduciary roles such as executor, personal representative, or trustee.  
- Running estate sales directly, or operating junk trucks or moving crews.  
- Daily caregiving or in-home personal care.

Those roles stay with:

- Your attorney and the court for legal decisions.  
- Your tax and financial professionals for money questions.  
- Any appointed fiduciary or trustee for legal responsibilities.  
- Independent vendors and trades for the physical work they perform.

I coordinate with those people and keep the property side on track, but I do not replace them.

---

## Where these services are available

Cleanout2Closing is based in Tucson and focused on Southern Arizona.

Most of my work today is in:

- Tucson and greater Tucson  
- Oro Valley and Marana  
- Vail and the Rita Ranch area  
- Green Valley, Sahuarita, and Catalina

As the mega site grows, the [Service Areas](/service-areas) and Arizona hub will show each city and neighborhood in more detail.

## How to choose the right service

You do not have to pick the perfect label before you reach out.

If a Tucson-area property is on your plate and it feels heavy, that is enough reason to start a conversation.  
During our first call we will:

- Talk about what has happened so far.  
- Clarify who is involved and what the timelines look like.  
- Decide which service category fits you best and what the first steps should be.

You are never locked into a box. The service adapts to your real situation as it evolves.

[Tell me what you are facing](/contact) and we will take the next step together.
