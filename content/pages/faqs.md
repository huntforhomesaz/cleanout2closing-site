## About Cleanout2Closing

### What is Cleanout2Closing?

Cleanout2Closing is a Realtor-led estate transition concierge service based in Tucson.

I help families, trustees, and professionals move a property from â€œfull and overwhelmingâ€ to â€œclean, documented, and sold.â€  
That includes coordinating cleanout, vendors, and the real estate sale itself so you are not juggling multiple companies.

### Are you a junk removal company, a moving company, or something else?

I am not a junk removal company or moving company.

Instead, I:

- Walk the property and help you see what needs to happen.  
- Build a simple, written plan from cleanout to closing.  
- Coordinate independent vendors such as junk removal, estate sale professionals, movers, cleaners, landscapers, and trades.  
- Represent you as your Tucson Realtor for the sale of the property.

Vendors set their own pricing and contracts. You review and approve their estimates before work is scheduled.

### Are you a cash buyer?

No. I am not a â€œwe buy houses for cashâ€ company.

I am a licensed Realtor in Tucson.  
My role is to coordinate the property side and help you choose the right way to sell, which may include:

- A traditional listing on the open market.  
- An as-is listing with limited prep.  
- Reviewing investor offers when that makes sense for your situation.

Part of our first conversation will be looking at which path fits your goals, timelines, and comfort level.

### Do you only work with estates?

Estate and transition properties are my focus, but the core service is the same:

- Inherited or probate homes.  
- Trust properties and trustee situations.  
- Senior transitions and downsizing.  
- Long-held rentals that are now ready to be sold as part of an estate.  
- Family properties with multiple decision makers.

If the property is part of a larger life change and feels heavy to handle, there is a good chance I can help.

## Who you are and whether this is a fit

### Who is Cleanout2Closing best suited for?

Cleanout2Closing is a good fit if:

- You have a Tucson area property tied to an estate, trust, senior move, or major transition.  
- You want one accountable person to coordinate cleanout, vendors, and the home sale.  
- You appreciate clear communication and written plans.  
- You are comfortable keeping legal and tax guidance with your attorney and financial professionals.

It is less of a fit if you want:

- A pure â€œcash for housesâ€ approach with no planning or vendor coordination.  
- A simple, non-estate sale where the property is already empty and straightforward.  
- A do-it-yourself approach where you prefer to call and manage every vendor personally.

### Can you help if I live in another state?

Yes.

Many of the families and trustees I help live outside Arizona.  
In those cases, I:

- Walk the property on your behalf and share photos or video.  
- Coordinate vendors, access, and schedules locally.  
- Keep you updated with agreed check in rhythms instead of random calls.  
- Guide the sale from pricing through closing and keep your attorney or fiduciary in the loop.

You do not need to fly in for every step unless you want to.

### Can you help if I already have an attorney or fiduciary?

Yes. That is common.

Attorneys, licensed fiduciaries, and trustees handle legal decisions, court filings, and the distribution of funds.  
I handle the property side and keep them supplied with:

- Vendor estimates.  
- Invoices and receipts.  
- Photos and status updates that are easy to add to their files.

I respect their role and stay within the scope of work we agree on together.

### Can you work with my existing Realtor?

Sometimes.

If you already have a trusted Realtor but need help with the cleanout and coordination side, we can talk.  
In some cases I act as a property-side coordinator while another Realtor handles the listing.  
In other cases, I serve as both the coordinator and the listing agent.

We will talk honestly about what makes the most sense for you and for the professionals already involved.

## How the process works

### What does the process look like from start to finish?

The short version:

1. We talk about your situation, timelines, and who is involved.  
2. I walk the property (in person or virtually) and document what is needed.  
3. I build a simple, written plan that ties cleanout, vendors, and sale together.  
4. I line up vendors and coordinate work once you approve estimates.  
5. I list and sell the home as your Tucson Realtor, keeping everyone updated.  
6. We close the sale and you end up with a clean property file and clear records.

You can read a step by step description on the How It Works page.

### How long does the process usually take?

It depends on:

- The condition of the property.  
- How full the home is.  
- Court or probate timelines.  
- Vendor availability and the level of work you choose.

Some families move from first contact to closing in a few months. Others take longer, especially if legal steps or family decisions need more time.

On our first call, we will talk through a realistic timeline for your specific situation.

### Do I need to empty the house before calling you?

No.

You do not have to sort or empty the house before we talk.  
In fact, it often works better if you contact me while the house is still full so we can plan:

- What you want to keep.  
- What can be donated or sold.  
- What should be removed.

We can then coordinate cleanout and other vendors in an organized way instead of rushing.

## Money, fees, and how vendors are handled

### How do your services get paid for?

On the real estate side, I work under standard Arizona listing and representation agreements as a licensed Realtor with Keller Williams in Tucson.  
We will talk through those details clearly before we sign anything so you understand how real estate fees work in your situation.

Vendor services such as junk removal, cleaning, landscaping, trades, and estate sales are billed through their own contracts.  
You approve estimates before work is scheduled.

Sometimes vendor invoices are paid up front.  
In other cases, depending on timing and structure, certain costs may be handled through escrow. We can talk through what is realistic for you once we understand the property and the work needed.

### Do you mark up vendor invoices?

No.

Vendors are independent businesses.  
They provide their own estimates, contracts, and invoices.  
You see the numbers directly, and we discuss them together before you approve work.

My value is in knowing which vendors to call, in what order, and how to keep the entire process organized and aligned with your goals.

### Do you handle bookkeeping or manage client funds?

No.

Here is the boundary:

- I collect and organize vendor estimates, invoices, receipts, and approval notes and deliver periodic summaries.  
- I do not perform bookkeeping, reconcile accounts, hold or move client funds, issue tax forms, or provide legal or accounting advice.  
- You, your attorney, fiduciary, or tax professional remain responsible for all accounting records and payments.

My role is to keep the paperwork organized and easy to use, not to act as your bookkeeper or accountant.

## Legal, tax, and fiduciary questions

### Do you give legal advice?

No.

I am not an attorney and do not give legal advice.  
Your attorney and the court handle:

- Probate filings and deadlines.  
- Trust interpretation and guidance.  
- Court approvals and required notices.  
- Legal responsibilities of personal representatives and trustees.

I coordinate the property and vendor side around that guidance.

### Do you give tax or financial advice?

No.

Questions such as capital gains, step-up in basis, and distribution of proceeds belong with your tax and financial professionals.

I can help gather the property-related information they need, such as:

- Closing documents.  
- Vendor invoices and receipts related to the property.  
- Summaries of work that was done and why.

### Can you act as executor, personal representative, or trustee?

No.

Those are legal roles.  
They belong to the individual or firm appointed in the will, trust, or by the court.

I work alongside that person or firm to:

- Coordinate the property side.  
- Provide documentation they can add to their file.  
- Keep the process moving without stepping into their legal responsibilities.

## What Cleanout2Closing does not do

### What is outside your scope?

To keep everyone protected, there are clear lines around what I do not do:

- I do not provide legal, tax, or accounting advice.  
- I do not serve as executor, personal representative, or trustee.  
- I do not operate junk trucks, moving crews, or estate sale events.  
- I do not provide daily in-home caregiving or personal care.  
- I do not make decisions about distributions between heirs.

Instead, I:

- Coordinate the property, vendor, and sale process.  
- Keep communication and documentation clear.  
- Work alongside the professionals you already have in place.

If you need help finding an attorney, fiduciary, or other professional, I can share options and you can choose who you are most comfortable with.

## Getting started

### What should I have ready before I contact you?

You do not need a stack of paperwork to start.

It helps if you can tell me:

- Where the property is located.  
- Your role (heir, trustee, personal representative, adult child, attorney, etc.).  
- Whether an attorney or fiduciary is already involved.  
- Whether anyone is still living in the home or if it is vacant.

If you have photos, that is a bonus, not a requirement.

### What is the best way to reach you?

You can:

- Use the contact form on the Contact page.  
- Call or text using the number listed on the site.  
- Email using the address provided there if you prefer to write everything out.

If you live outside Arizona, we can easily start by phone or video.
