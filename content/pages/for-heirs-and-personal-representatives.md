  - question: "Do I have to clean out the house myself before talking to you?"
    answer: "No. You do not need to empty the house before we talk. In fact, it often works better if we connect while the home is still full so we can plan what to keep, donate, sell, and remove in an organized way."

# For heirs and personal representatives

If you are reading this, you are probably carrying at least two things at once:

- Grief or stress from losing someone, and  
- Responsibility for a house in or around Tucson that now needs to be dealt with.

You might have been named as:

- An heir who has become the â€œpoint person,â€ or  
- The personal representative / executor in the will, or  
- A co-decision maker alongside siblings or other family members.

On top of that, the house may be full of belongings, and the legal words â€œprobate,â€ â€œestate,â€ or â€œtrustâ€ are now part of your life.

Cleanout2Closing exists to help with the property side of all this.

This page is for you personally, not just â€œthe estate.â€  
It explains what to do first, what to expect, and how I help you move the house from full and overwhelming to clean, documented, and sold.

## What you are probably worried about right now

Every situation is different, but heirs and personal representatives tend to ask the same questions at the beginning.

### â€œWhat should I do first with the house?â€

Common fears:

- â€œIf I touch anything before court, am I in trouble?â€  
- â€œDo I have to clean everything out before we can even talk about selling?â€  
- â€œIs there a step-by-step list of what happens with the house in probate?â€

What usually helps:

- Making sure the property is secure and basic utilities are safe.  
- Clarifying your role and authority with your attorney or the court.  
- Getting a clear picture of the homeâ€™s condition before making big decisions.

You do not have to figure that list out by yourself.  
Part of my job is helping you see which property steps make sense at each stage.

### â€œHow do I handle my siblings or other heirs?â€

Common fears:

- â€œWe are already arguing, and we have not even started.â€  
- â€œI do not want to be accused of doing the wrong thing.â€  
- â€œSome of us want to sell as-is, others want to fix everything.â€

What usually helps:

- Clear, written options instead of vague opinions.  
- Real numbers for different levels of prep and sale.  
- A neutral voice who is not another family member.

I cannot fix every family dynamic, but I can give everyone the same property facts so you are arguing less about â€œwhat is trueâ€ and more about â€œwhat choice makes sense.â€

### â€œWhat if I do something the court wonâ€™t like?â€

Common fears:

- â€œIf I make a mistake with the house, can I get in legal trouble?â€  
- â€œWill the judge or my attorney think I handled things badly?â€  
- â€œWhat needs written approval before we move ahead?â€

What usually helps:

- Keeping legal decisions with your attorney and the court.  
- Keeping the property side documented and organized.  
- Moving at a pace that respects both the law and the real-world needs of the house.

I am not your attorney and I do not give legal advice.  
I keep the property and vendor side organized so your legal team has what they need.

## How I help heirs and personal representatives specifically

Cleanout2Closing is built around your reality as an heir or personal representative, not just â€œanother listing.â€

Here is what that looks like in practice.

### 1. Listen to your situation before giving advice

Before we talk about cleanout or sale, I ask about:

- Your role (heir, personal representative, trustee, or a mix).  
- Whether an attorney or licensed fiduciary is already involved.  
- Who else has a voice in decisions (siblings, other relatives, beneficiaries).  
- Whether the property is occupied or vacant.  
- What the court or trust has already decided so far.

You should never feel rushed into decisions before we understand your situation.

### 2. Walk and document the property

Next, we make sure someone who is on your side has actually seen the house.

I:

- Walk the property in person in the Tucson area.  
- Take photos (and video when helpful).  
- Note obvious issues and the general level of contents.  
- Flag anything that looks urgent (safety, leaks, security).

You get a simple, clear summary you can share with siblings, your attorney, or a fiduciary.

### 3. Build a simple plan from â€œtodayâ€ to â€œclosingâ€

Once we know your role and what the property looks like in real life, I draft a straightforward plan that:

- Lists the big decisions in plain language (keep, donate, sell, discard; how much work to do; when to list).  
- Connects cleanout, vendor work, and sale into one sequence.  
- Notes where your attorney or the court needs to review or approve things.  
- Gives you a rough timeline based on your situation and the Tucson market.

You finally have something you can show the rest of the family instead of trying to explain it from memory.

### 4. Coordinate vendors so you are not the project manager

With your approval (and your attorney or fiduciaryâ€™s when needed), I:

- Gather estimates from cleanout, estate sale, donation, cleaning, landscaping, and repair vendors.  
- Help you compare those estimates in plain English.  
- Coordinate schedules and access so vendors are not tripping over each other.  
- Keep track of invoices and receipts on the property side.

You are still in control of what gets approved.  
You are just not the one doing all the chasing and scheduling.

### 5. Align the work with a realistic sale strategy

As your Tucson Realtor, I make sure the property work supports a sale that makes sense for your situation.

We talk honestly about:

- As-is vs. light prep vs. more complete prep.  
- Likely buyer types for your kind of home and location.  
- Timing and price ranges, not promises.

The goal is to make decisions you can explain later:

- â€œHere were our options.â€  
- â€œHere is what we chose, and why.â€  
- â€œHere are the records to back it up.â€

### 6. Represent the estate or trust in the sale

When the home is ready, I:

- Price and list the property in the MLS.  
- Handle showings and buyer questions.  
- Walk you through offers, contingencies, and counteroffers in plain language.  
- Coordinate inspections, access, and any agreed repairs during escrow.  
- Stay with you through closing and make sure you have the property documents you need for your file.

You do not have to become a real estate expert on top of everything else.  
You just need to understand your choices and stay informed.

## What I do and what I do not do (for heirs and PRs)

Clear boundaries matter even more when you have legal responsibilities.

### What I do

- Help you see what the property really needs and in what order.  
- Build a written plan from cleanout to closing.  
- Coordinate independent vendors and trades.  
- Organize property-side estimates, invoices, receipts, and notes.  
- Represent the estate or trust as a licensed Realtor in Tucson.  
- Keep communication steady and calm with you, your family, and your professionals.

### What I do not do

- I do not act as your attorney or give legal advice.  
- I do not act as your accountant or give tax advice.  
- I do not serve as executor, personal representative, trustee, or licensed fiduciary.  
- I do not run junk trucks, moving crews, or estate sale events myself.  
- I do not make final decisions about distributions between heirs.

Your legal, tax, and fiduciary professionals keep those responsibilities.  
I keep the property and sale side organized so their job is easier, not harder.

### Important accounting boundary

I will collect and organize vendor estimates, invoices, receipts, and approval notes and deliver periodic summaries.  
I do not perform bookkeeping, reconcile accounts, hold funds, issue tax forms, or provide legal or accounting advice.  
You and your fiduciary or accounting team remain responsible for all accounting records and payments.

## Common â€œheir and PRâ€ questions

### Do I have to wait until probate is finished to talk to you?

No.

Many heirs and personal representatives reach out while probate or trust work is still in progress.  
Your attorney will tell us what can and cannot be done at each stage.  
Within that guidance, we can often:

- Walk and document the property.  
- Plan cleanout and vendor work.  
- Prepare for a sale as soon as it is legally allowed.

### What if my siblings donâ€™t trust each other?

That is common, especially when money and memories are both involved.

I help by:

- Providing the same written plan and updates to everyone you designate.  
- Keeping the focus on property facts and options.  
- Staying neutral on family dynamics while making sure decisions are documented.

You and your legal team still make the hard calls.  
I make sure those calls are based on clear information.

### What if the house is in worse shape than we thought?

We deal with what is actually there, not what we hoped would be there.

Once we see the real condition, we look at:

- Minimum work needed for safety and basic marketability.  
- What an as-is sale might look like.  
- Whether modest additional work would improve the outcome enough to be worth it.

You do not have to solve all of that alone.  
We will talk through the tradeoffs step by step.

## If this sounds like your situation, here is your next step

You do not need a perfect plan before you reach out.  
You do not need the house to be cleaned out, or every sibling to agree.

You just need to be willing to talk about:

- Where the property is.  
- Your role (heir, personal representative, trustee).  
- What worries you most right now.

Start with the core service page that supports you:

- [Inherited and probate property: from cleanout to closing](/services/inherited-and-probate-property)

When you are ready, tell me what you are dealing with and we will map out a clear, realistic path from the house you have today to a clean, documented, sold property that you can move past.
