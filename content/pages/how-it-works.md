  - question: "Do I have to wait for the court or attorney before talking to you?"
    answer: "No. Many families call me while they are still waiting on court dates or legal guidance. I do not give legal or tax advice, but I can review your situation, walk the property, and build a property side plan that fits the guidance you receive from your attorney or fiduciary."

  - question: "How involved do I have to be in day to day vendor work?"
    answer: "Most clients prefer to stay out of the day to day details. I coordinate vendors, schedules, access, and progress updates for you. You stay in control of decisions and approvals without having to manage every phone call or appointment yourself."

  - question: "Do you only work in Tucson?"
    answer: "Tucson is my primary focus, including nearby communities such as Oro Valley, Vail, Sahuarita, Green Valley, and Catalina. If your property is outside these areas, we can talk through the details and decide if I am the right fit or if a referral would serve you better."

# How Cleanout2Closing works in Tucson

When you are dealing with an inherited house, a senior move, or an estate in Tucson, the property side can feel like its own second job. There are belongings to sort, vendors to manage, timelines to hit, and a home that still needs to be sold.

Cleanout2Closing is built to take that off your plate. I coordinate the journey from the first conversation about the house through a clean, documented closing, so you have one accountable point of contact instead of juggling a list of vendors and a separate Realtor.

If you only have a minute, here is the short version.

> Short version if you are in a hurry:  
> We talk about your situation and timelines, I walk the property, build a simple plan, and coordinate cleanout, vendors, and prep around your legal and family needs. Then I list and sell the home in Tucson as your Realtor, while keeping you and your attorney or fiduciary updated until the sale closes.

The rest of this page walks through that journey in plain English.

## Is this what you are dealing with?

This page is for you if any of these sounds familiar:

- You are responsible for a Tucson house after a death, trust event, or probate.
- A parent is moving into assisted living or downsizing and the home still holds a lifetime of belongings.
- You live outside Tucson and need someone local to manage the property and vendors.
- Your family is stuck because no one has time to coordinate cleanout, repairs, and the sale.
- You are a trustee, personal representative, or fiduciary who needs clear documentation and one property contact.

If you are unsure whether your situation fits, you can still reach out. A quick conversation will usually make that clear.

## Situations I handle all the time

These are the kinds of transitions where a â€œcleanout to closingâ€ approach helps most:

- Probate property where the court sets the pace and you need to keep the property side moving in step.
- Inherited homes that are still full and feel emotionally heavy to tackle.
- Senior transitions where someone is moving into assisted living or a smaller place and the house needs to be emptied and sold.
- Family properties with multiple decision makers who need neutral coordination and clear updates.
- Tucson homes owned by out of state heirs or owners who cannot be here in person.
- Cases where vendors, estate sale companies, or junk removal crews are already involved and you need them organized around one plan.

If your situation is close to any of these, the same basic process applies.

## How I take you from cleanout to closing

Every family and every property is different, but the structure stays the same. Here is the step by step journey.

### Step 1 â€“ Talk through your situation and timelines

We start with a simple call.

I ask about:

- Who is involved in decisions.
- Where you are in any legal or probate process.
- The condition of the house and contents as you understand them.
- Your goals and constraints, including timing and finances.

There is no cost and no pressure. The goal is to understand what you are carrying and whether I am the right fit.

### Step 2 â€“ Walk the property

Next, I walk the property with you or on your behalf.

This can be:

- In person, if you are local.
- Virtual, using video and photos, if you are out of the area.

During the walkthrough I look at:

- Interior and exterior condition.
- Volume and type of belongings.
- Safety or access issues that affect vendors.
- Obvious items that may need specialist handling.

This gives us a clear, shared picture of what the property needs before it can be sold.

### Step 3 â€“ Build a simple, written plan

After the walkthrough, I put together a straightforward plan that connects cleanout, vendors, and the sale.

This usually includes:

- A short summary of the situation in plain language.
- A sequence of steps, from cleanout through listing and escrow.
- Which parts I will coordinate on the property side.
- Where your attorney or fiduciary will guide legal decisions.
- A realistic sense of what can happen now and what must wait on the court or other approvals.

For many families this is the first time the entire journey is laid out in one place.

### Step 4 â€“ Line up the right vendors

Once you are comfortable with the plan, I start lining up vendors based on what the property needs.

Examples include:

- Cleanout and junk removal companies.
- Estate sale or auction professionals.
- Cleaners, landscapers, and handymen.
- Trades such as roofers, plumbers, and electricians when needed.

I request estimates, help you compare options, and organize schedules. You approve work before it is booked. Vendors are independent businesses with their own pricing and contracts, and I keep their work aligned with the overall plan.

### Step 5 â€“ Coordinate cleanout and prep around your timelines

As work begins, I stay close to three things:

- Legal and court timelines.
- Family and move dates.
- Practical issues like utilities, locks, and access.

I coordinate:

- Vendor access, lockbox or key handling, and site logistics.
- What happens to belongings that are kept, donated, or removed.
- Progress photos or videos so you can see changes without being on site.

You do not have to manage a pile of separate calls and texts. You hear from me with updates and decisions, not from every vendor individually unless you want that.

### Step 6 â€“ List, sell, and close the property

When the home is ready, I move into the real estate side as your Tucson Realtor.

This includes:

- Helping you choose a pricing and sale strategy that matches your goals and the condition of the property.
- Preparing the home for photos and showings at a level that makes sense for your situation.
- Listing the property on the MLS and marketing it.
- Negotiating offers, keeping you informed, and coordinating with your attorney or fiduciary where required.
- Managing the property side of inspections, access, and repairs during escrow.
- Staying with you through closing and making sure you have the property related documentation you need.

The goal is one coordinated journey rather than separate â€œcleanout,â€ â€œvendor,â€ and â€œsaleâ€ projects you have to connect yourself.

## What I do and what I do not do

A big part of reducing stress is knowing exactly who handles what.

### What I handle

You can expect me to:

- Coordinate the property side of the transition from first call to closing.
- Walk the home and document what the property needs.
- Build and maintain a realistic action plan tied to your timelines.
- Identify, introduce, and coordinate qualified vendors and trades.
- Organize estimates, invoices, receipts, and simple status summaries for your records.
- Guide pricing, marketing, and negotiation as your Tucson Realtor.
- Keep you, and when appropriate your attorney or fiduciary, updated on property progress.

### What stays with your attorney, fiduciary, or vendors

There are important boundaries to protect you and the professionals involved.

- Legal decisions, probate filings, court deadlines, and approvals stay with your attorney or the court.
- Tax advice, accounting, and distribution of proceeds stay with your tax and financial professionals.
- Vendors set their own pricing, contracts, and payment terms. You approve their work and pay them directly or through escrow when that is appropriate.
- Roles such as executor, personal representative, trustee, or fiduciary stay with the person or firm legally appointed to do that work.

I am happy to coordinate with your attorney, fiduciary, or tax professional so property updates, estimates, and receipts are easy to plug into their files.

### Important boundaries and disclaimers

Cleanout2Closing does not provide legal, tax, accounting, or fiduciary advice. I coordinate the property, vendor, and real estate sale process alongside your chosen professionals. Legal and financial decisions remain with you and the professionals you select.

Cleanout2Closing also does not operate junk removal trucks, moving crews, or estate sales. I recommend and coordinate independent vendors and trades. They are responsible for the work they perform, and you always see and approve estimates before work is scheduled.

## What you can expect when we work together

Families and professionals usually tell me they want three things: clarity, communication, and follow through. Here is how that looks in practice.

- One primary point of contact  
  You do not have to figure out which vendor to call for every question. You reach out to me, and I handle coordination on the property side.

- Clear written plan  
  You receive a simple written plan that lays out the steps from where you are today through cleanout, prep, listing, and closing. When something changes, we adjust the plan rather than starting over.

- Communication that fits your situation  
  For some families, a weekly summary email is enough. For others, especially out of state owners or trustees, we add more frequent check ins by phone, text, or video.

- Documentation that is easy to keep  
  I organize estimates, invoices, and receipts in a way that makes sense for you and for any attorney, fiduciary, or accountant who needs them.

- Respect for your time and energy  
  I will tell you what decisions are on your plate and what I can handle. The goal is to reduce the number of things you have to remember, not add more.

## How this has worked for other families

Here are two common patterns I see.

- An inherited home in Tucson with a full house of belongings. Heirs live in different cities, and one person is the personal representative. We start with a group call, I walk the property, and we agree on what will be kept, donated, or removed. I coordinate cleanout, light repairs, and landscaping, then list and sell the home with regular updates for everyone. The personal representative ends up with organized records for their file.

- A senior move into assisted living where the family is already overwhelmed. I meet with the family, map out a plan that ties the move date to the cleanout and sale, and coordinate movers, cleanout vendors, and basic prep. The family focuses on the person, not the property, and still knows what is happening with the house at each step.

Your details will be different, but the goal is the same. One plan, one point of contact, and a clear path from a full, stressful house to a sold property.
