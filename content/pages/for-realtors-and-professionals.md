  - question: "Who is Cleanout2Closing built for on the professional side?"
    answer: "Cleanout2Closing is the consumer-facing brand I use when helping families, heirs, trustees, and seniors with estate transition properties in Tucson. On the professional side, I partner most often with Realtors, attorneys, licensed fiduciaries, senior communities, and lenders who need a reliable, on-the-ground coordinator for the property and sale."
    schema: true
  - question: "How is this different from referring to a traditional Realtor or a cleanout company?"
    answer: "A traditional Realtor usually focuses on the sale. A cleanout company focuses on hauling and labor. I bridge the gap. As a Tucson Realtor with deep hands-on service background, I coordinate cleanout, vendors, documentation, and the sale itself so your client has one accountable point of contact from first call through closing."
    schema: true
  - question: "Do you provide legal, tax, or fiduciary advice, or act as a subcontractor under my firm?"
    answer: "No. I do not provide legal, tax, or fiduciary advice, and I do not act as a subcontractor or fiduciary. You remain in control of legal and financial guidance. I coordinate the property, vendors, and real estate sale alongside your instructions and provide organized documentation you can plug into your file."
    schema: true
  - question: "How does AZ Probate Concierge fit with Cleanout2Closing?"
    answer: "Cleanout2Closing is the consumer-facing brand families see. AZ Probate Concierge is my professional-facing brand for attorneys, fiduciaries, and other pros who need a more formal, documentation-heavy engagement. Both are led by me, in Tucson, and both feed the same underlying process from cleanout to closing."

# For Realtors and professionals

If you are on this page, you probably live in one of these worlds:

- You are a Realtor with clients facing an inherited, trust, or senior transition property.  
- You are an attorney or licensed fiduciary who needs the property side handled and documented well.  
- You are part of a senior community, care team, or lending group that sees families struggle with "what do we do with the house?"

Cleanout2Closing is the consumer-facing brand I use when I step into those situations as a Realtor-led estate transition concierge.

This page explains how I work with you and your clients, how I stay inside your lane instead of competing with it, and what you can expect if you introduce me into a case.

## Who I partner with (and how)

I keep the partner list simple.

Most of my professional relationships fall into a few groups:

- Realtors and real estate teams  
- Attorneys (probate, trust, elder law, family law when property is involved)  
- Licensed fiduciaries and personal representatives  
- Senior living communities and care teams  
- Lenders and financial professionals with estate or equity cases  

My role in each case is similar:

- You handle your core expertise: law, fiduciary duties, lending, care, or primary agency.  
- I handle the property: cleanout, vendor coordination, and the sale as a licensed Tucson Realtor.  
- Together, we give the client a calm, coordinated path from "overwhelmed house" to "closed file."

Cleanout2Closing is the brand families see.  
AZ Probate Concierge is the brand you may see on professional materials, documentation, and LinkedIn.  
Both roll up to me and to the same process.

## How this is different from "just another Realtor" or "just a cleanout company"

I am not a labor crew and I am not a nameless "we buy houses for cash" postcard.

Here is the practical distinction.

### Typical path 1 — Traditional Realtor only

- Strong on pricing, marketing, escrow, and negotiation.  
- Less involved in vendor sequencing and heavy cleanout.  
- Clients end up juggling 3–5 companies before the home is even ready to list.

This works fine when a home is already empty and lightly prepped.  
It breaks down when there is a full house, complex timing, or legal constraints.

### Typical path 2 — Cleanout company + separate Realtor

- Crews handle hauling and maybe some light demo.  
- They are not focused on the eventual buyer, disclosures, or negotiation.  
- Realtor gets involved after, sometimes with missing documentation or misaligned work.

This is better than nothing, but you still have two separate tracks to manage.

### The path I offer — Realtor-led coordination from day one

I combine:

- My background as owner of a successful junk removal / demolition company in Tucson.  
- My current work as a licensed Realtor with a high-volume local team.  
- My focus on estate and transition properties specifically.

The result for your client:

- One accountable person coordinating cleanout, vendors, and the sale.  
- Work scopes and timing aligned with the expected sale strategy.  
- Organized documentation that supports your file and your role.

Your role stays intact.  
You are not handing your client to a competitor who wants to replace you.  
You are plugging in a property-side specialist who understands how your lane works.

## How I work with Realtors

If you are a Realtor, there are two main ways we might work together.

### 1. You remain the primary agent

In some cases, you already have a signed listing or long-term client relationship.

You keep that.

In those situations, I can:

- Step in as a property-side coordinator under your umbrella, focused on cleanout and vendor sequencing.  
- Help your client build a plan from "as-is" to "ready to list" that supports your pricing and marketing strategy.  
- Coordinate cleanout, basic repairs, and access with your branding front and center.

Your client sees that you have brought in someone who knows how to manage the heavy lifting without turning it into a separate relationship.

If we work this way, we are clear and transparent about roles and agreements up front so there is no confusion for the client.

### 2. You refer a case where you are not the right fit

In other cases, you may:

- Get a call from a past client's family who moved out of area.  
- Be outside Tucson but need a local partner to handle a complicated estate property.  
- Decide that your own bandwidth is better spent on your core farm or niche.

In those situations, you can:

- Introduce me to your client or their representative.  
- Stay in the loop at the level you choose.  
- Trust that I will stay in my lane, not solicit your unrelated business, and treat your relationship with respect.

If there is a referral agreement in place, we align it with broker policies and make sure the client understands the structure.

Either way, your reputation is protected by how I show up and how I communicate with your client.

## How I work with attorneys and fiduciaries

Attorneys and licensed fiduciaries have a different lens.

You are thinking about:

- Duties of prudence and loyalty.  
- Documentation that will hold up if questioned.  
- A client who is already under strain.

When you introduce me into a matter, you can expect:

- I listen first to how you frame the engagement and your role.  
- I treat your instructions as the guardrails for the property plan.  
- I keep the property side organized in a way your file will thank you for later.

Specifically, on the property side I can:

- Walk and document the home with photos and simple written summaries.  
- Gather and organize vendor estimates for your review and your client's approval.  
- Coordinate work once authorized and keep receipts and invoices in order.  
- Represent the estate or trust as a Realtor for pricing, listing, and negotiation.

And just as important, I will not:

- Provide legal advice to your client.  
- Interpret or draft legal documents.  
- Act as executor, personal representative, trustee, or licensed fiduciary.  
- Hold client funds or perform bookkeeping.

Your role stays where it belongs: in the legal and fiduciary domain.  
My role stays in the property and real estate domain.

## How I work with senior communities and care teams

If you are part of a senior living community, care team, or placement service, you already know:

- The move itself is only half the story.  
- The house can quietly stall out plans if nobody steps in to manage it.

When you introduce me to a resident or their family:

- I keep the focus on the person first and the property second.  
- I build a property plan that respects medical appointments, routines, and move-in dates.  
- I coordinate vendors in ways that reduce chaos and foot-traffic during sensitive times.

I do not provide medical care, transportation, or personal support.  
I coordinate the property, vendors, and eventual sale in a way that supports the care plan you are building.

## Cleanout2Closing vs AZ Probate Concierge

Professionally, I operate under two connected brands:

- Cleanout2Closing — the consumer-facing estate transition brand.  
- AZ Probate Concierge — the professional-facing brand built for attorneys, fiduciaries, and other pros.

On the ground, the process is the same:

- I listen to the legal, family, and financial picture.  
- I walk and document the property.  
- I build a plan from cleanout to closing.  
- I coordinate vendors and documentation.  
- I represent the property as a Realtor in Tucson.

The difference is:

- Cleanout2Closing language and materials are built for families and seniors.  
- AZ Probate Concierge materials speak directly to your professional concerns: scope, documentation, boundaries, and compliance.

If you are an attorney, fiduciary, or professional decision maker, I will often give you AZ Probate Concierge materials so you can see the engagement structure in more depth.

Your clients, however, may meet me first under the Cleanout2Closing name, because it is easier to hear and remember at a stressful time.

## What your clients experience when you introduce me

When you connect a client, heir, or family to me, they can expect:

- One steady point of contact for the property and sale.  
- A clear conversation about their situation and what "success" looks like.  
- A walkthrough and simple explanation of what the home needs (and what it does not).  
- A written plan from today to closing that they can share with you.  
- Vendor coordination that does not leave them managing every call and schedule.  
- Real estate representation with local knowledge of Tucson and surrounding areas.

They will also hear clear boundaries:

- I am not their attorney or tax professional.  
- I am not their fiduciary or bookkeeper.  
- I am not showing up with a truck as a labor crew.  

I am their property-side guide from cleanout to closing, working alongside the professionals they already trust.

---

## Documentation and accounting boundaries

To support your file, I can:

- Collect and organize vendor estimates, invoices, receipts, and approval notes.  
- Provide periodic summaries of property work and status.  
- Deliver closing documents and related property records in a simple package.

I do not:

- Perform bookkeeping or reconcile accounts.  
- Hold or move client funds.  
- Issue tax forms or prepare tax filings.  
- Provide legal or accounting advice.

You and your professional team stay responsible for those functions.

## Local focus: Tucson and Southern Arizona

My work is grounded in Southern Arizona, with a focus on:

- Tucson and greater Tucson  
- Oro Valley and Marana  
- Vail and the Rita Ranch area  
- Sahuarita and Green Valley  
- Catalina and nearby foothill communities  

If you serve clients with property in these areas, I am likely a good fit.  
If the property is farther out, I will be direct with you about whether I can help or whether a more local partner would better serve the case.

---

## Common questions from professionals

### Will you market to my client outside the scope of this engagement?

No.

When you introduce me, I am there to serve the specific property and situation we agree on.  
I am not there to compete with your core relationship.  
If other needs come up, I bring those back to you, and we decide together what makes sense.

### How do fees work?

On the real estate side, I work under standard Arizona listing and representation agreements through my brokerage in Tucson.  
We discuss and document those terms clearly before any client signs.

Vendors such as cleanout crews, estate sale companies, cleaners, landscapers, and trades:

- Bill through their own contracts.  
- Provide estimates that your client, you, or a fiduciary can review and approve.  

If we have a referral or fee-sharing arrangement, we align it with broker and professional rules and keep it transparent.

### Can you help me with a file that is already in progress?

Often, yes.

If you already have:

- A partially cleaned-out property.  
- Past vendor work with incomplete documentation.  
- A stalled sale or failed listing.

We can step in, assess where things stand, and rebuild a clearer plan from there.

## How to introduce me into a case

You can introduce me in whatever way fits your relationship:

- A warm email introducing me by name and copying your client.  
- A brief three-way call to align expectations and next steps.  
- A simple, "We have a property-side specialist I trust; would you like an introduction?" in your regular meetings.

From there, I:

- Take ownership of the property conversation.  
- Keep you in the loop at the level you prefer.  
- Make sure your role is respected and supported, not replaced.
