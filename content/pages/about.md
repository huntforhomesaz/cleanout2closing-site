# About Cleanout2Closing and Bradley Hunt

Cleanout2Closing is a simple idea that grew out of years of messy real-world work in Tucson:

Most families, heirs, and trustees do not just need a Realtor.  
They need someone who will help them move a property from full and overwhelming to clean, documented, and sold, without handing them off to a dozen different companies.

My name is Bradley Hunt.  
I built Cleanout2Closing so you have one accountable point of contact for the property side of an estate or transition.

## Who I am

A few basics first:

- I have lived in Tucson for more than 38 years.  
- I am a U.S. Navy veteran.  
- I am a licensed Realtor with Keller Williams Southern Arizona, on The Stratton Group team.  
- Before real estate, I owned and operated Grunt-Work LLC here in Southern Arizona, a junk removal, landscaping, and demolition company that grew past $500,000 in annual revenue.  
- I later served as Director of Sales and Marketing at the Better Business Bureau of Southern Arizona.

In plain terms, I have spent years:

- In people's homes and yards, helping them through stressful projects.  
- Around heavy cleanouts, repairs, and "we do not know where to start" situations.  
- Inside organizations where trust, documentation, and clear communication matter.

Cleanout2Closing is the way I bring all of that together for families and professionals dealing with estate and transition properties in Tucson.

## Why I built Cleanout2Closing

Over the years, I kept seeing the same gap:

- Cleanout companies could move stuff, but they were not thinking about disclosures, buyers, or escrow.  
- Traditional Realtors could sell the house, but many did not want to manage heavy cleanout or vendor sequencing.  
- Families were left trying to coordinate everything while grieving, working, or caring for a senior.

In inherited, probate, and senior-transition cases, that gap shows up as:

- A full house that sits for months because nobody has time to tackle it.  
- Rushed decisions about repairs or as-is sales without clear information.  
- Stress between siblings or between families and professionals because the property feels out of control.

Cleanout2Closing exists to close that gap.

The goal is not fancy branding.  
The goal is a steady, practical process that takes the property from "we do not know where to start" to "we are closed and the records are in order."

## How my background helps your situation

### Hands-on service and project work

As the owner of Grunt-Work LLC, I:

- Walked thousands of properties in Southern Arizona.  
- Managed crews, equipment, and tight schedules.  
- Dealt with hoarding situations, full garages, unsafe sheds, and everything in between.  
- Worked with mortgage companies, Realtors, and families who needed properties cleaned up and ready for whatever was next.

That means I do not get shocked by a full house or a rough yard.  
I understand how long things actually take and what it really takes to get a property ready for buyers, inspectors, and appraisers.

### Real estate and negotiation

As a Realtor on The Stratton Group team at Keller Williams Southern Arizona:

- I work inside one of Tucson's top-performing real estate teams.  
- I have access to current data on how different properties perform in different areas and conditions.  
- I see every week how buyers respond to "as-is," "lightly prepped," and "fully polished" homes.

This helps you:

- Compare real options instead of guessing.  
- Align cleanout and repair decisions with actual buyer behavior in the Tucson market.  
- Move from work for its own sake to work that supports your goals.

### Trust and documentation mindset

My time with the Better Business Bureau taught me:

- How important clear expectations and boundaries are.  
- How much people value simple, honest explanations over sales talk.  
- How documentation protects everyone when questions come up later.

That shows up in Cleanout2Closing as:

- Written plans instead of vague promises.  
- Clear statements about what I do and what I do not do.  
- Organized property-side records that attorneys and fiduciaries can actually use.

## How Cleanout2Closing works in one sentence

Cleanout2Closing is a Realtor-led estate transition concierge service in Tucson that coordinates cleanout, vendors, and the sale of the property as one connected process from the first conversation through closing.

That breaks down into:

- One point of contact for the property.  
- A clear, step-by-step plan.  
- Vendor coordination that aligns with your sale strategy.  
- Real estate representation from a local agent who understands this type of situation.

## Cleanout2Closing and AZ Probate Concierge

You may see both names:

- Cleanout2Closing — consumer-facing, focused on families, heirs, seniors, and trustees.  
- AZ Probate Concierge — professional-facing, built for attorneys, fiduciaries, and other pros.

They are two doorways into the same service.

- If you are a family or heir, you will usually see the Cleanout2Closing name first.  
- If you are an attorney or fiduciary, you may see AZ Probate Concierge materials that speak more directly to your documentation and compliance needs.

In both cases:

- I am the one you are working with in Tucson.  
- The process, boundaries, and standards remain the same.

---

## What you can expect when we work together

If you call, email, or reach out through the contact form, you can expect:

- A calm, pressure-free conversation about your situation.  
- Clear questions about your role, timelines, and who else is involved.  
- Straight talk about what the property really needs and what it does not.  
- A simple written plan you can share with family and professionals.  
- Coordination of cleanout and vendor work once you approve the direction.  
- Real estate representation that fits your goals, not mine.

You will also hear clear boundaries:

- I will not push you to do more work on the property than makes sense.  
- I will not promise legal, tax, or accounting outcomes.  
- I will not disappear once the listing goes live; I stay involved from cleanout through closing.

## What I do and what I do not do

### What I do

- Coordinate the property side for inherited, probate, trust, senior transition, and out-of-state owner situations in Tucson and nearby communities.  
- Walk and document the property so you are making decisions based on real conditions.  
- Build and adjust a written plan from cleanout to closing.  
- Identify, introduce, and coordinate independent vendors and trades.  
- Organize vendor estimates, invoices, receipts, and simple approval notes.  
- Represent you as a licensed Realtor in Tucson for the sale of the property.  
- Communicate in plain language with you, your family, and your professionals.

### What I do not do

- I do not provide legal, tax, or accounting advice.  
- I do not act as executor, personal representative, trustee, or licensed fiduciary.  
- I do not perform bookkeeping, reconcile accounts, hold client funds, or issue tax forms.  
- I do not operate junk trucks, moving crews, or estate sale events myself.  
- I do not make distribution decisions between heirs or beneficiaries.

Your attorney, fiduciary, tax professional, and vendors keep those responsibilities.  
I keep the property and sale side coordinated and transparent.

---

## Where I work

Cleanout2Closing is focused on Southern Arizona, especially:

- Tucson and greater Tucson  
- Oro Valley and Marana  
- Vail and the Rita Ranch area  
- Sahuarita and Green Valley  
- Catalina and nearby foothill communities  

If your property is in or near these areas, there is a strong chance I can help.  
If it is farther away, I will tell you honestly whether I am the right fit or whether a local referral might be better.

## If this sounds like what you need

If you are an heir, trustee, senior, out-of-state owner, or professional staring at a Tucson-area property that feels heavy, you do not have to carry it alone.

You do not need the house cleaned out.  
You do not need all the paperwork organized.  
You do not need every family member to agree.

You just need to be ready to talk about:

- Where the property is.  
- Your role.  
- What worries you most right now.

From there, we can build a clear, realistic path from cleanout to closing.
