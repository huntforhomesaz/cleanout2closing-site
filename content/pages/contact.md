# Tell me what you are facing, and I will map out your options

Reaching out for help with an estate or transition property can feel like a big step.  
My goal is to make it simple and calm.

Use the form on this page to tell me what is going on with the property in or around Tucson. I will review what you share, then follow up with clear next steps so you can decide if working together feels right. There is no cost or obligation for this first conversation.

If you prefer, you can also call or text using the contact details on this page. Whatever is easiest for you right now.

## This is for you if

This page is the right place to start if any of these sound like you:

- You are dealing with a probate or inherited home in Tucson and are not sure where to start.  
- You are helping a parent or loved one move into assisted living or downsize, and the house feels overwhelming.  
- You live outside Arizona and need a local point of contact to coordinate vendors and the sale.  
- Your family has a shared property and decisions keep stalling or turning into stress.  
- You already have an attorney, fiduciary, or trustee involved and need someone to manage the property and vendors.  
- You want one accountable person to guide you from cleanout to closing instead of juggling multiple companies.

If you are not sure whether Cleanout2Closing is the right fit, it is still fine to reach out. Part of my job is to help you figure that out.

## What happens when you reach out

I keep the first steps simple and low pressure.

1. **You share your situation**  
   You send a short note through the form or reach out by phone or text. A few details help. For example, where the property is, your role, and whether there is an attorney or fiduciary already in place.

2. **I review and respond with a simple plan**  
   I look at what you shared and may ask a few clarifying questions. Then I outline a basic plan. That might include an initial call, a property walkthrough in Tucson, or a rough sequence of cleanout, vendors, and sale.

3. **We decide together on next steps**  
   You stay in control. If the plan feels helpful, we set up a time to talk in more detail or meet in person. If not, you still leave with a clearer view of your options and can decide what to do next.

You will not be pushed into signing paperwork on the first contact. The goal is to understand what you are facing and see if I am the right person to help.

## What you can expect from me

When you contact me about a Tucson area property, you can expect:

- **Calm, straightforward communication**  
  I explain your options in plain English and keep the focus on what is realistic for you and your family.

- **One accountable point of contact**  
  I coordinate cleanout, vendors, and the real estate sale so you are not repeating yourself to five different companies.

- **Local experience with estate and senior transitions**  
  I am a licensed Realtor in Tucson and a member of The Stratton Group at Keller Williams. I have lived in Tucson for over 38 years and previously owned a successful cleanout and demolition company, so I understand what it takes to move a property from cluttered to ready for buyers.

- **Respect for your legal and fiduciary team**  
  If you already have an attorney, fiduciary, trustee, or other professionals involved, I work alongside them. I provide documentation, photos, and updates so they have what they need for their files.

- **Clear boundaries about my role**  
  I am not an attorney, accountant, or tax professional. I do not provide legal or tax advice. My role is to coordinate the property, vendors, and sale alongside your attorney or fiduciary.

If you want to see more about how the process works before you reach out, you can also review the How It Works page and Services page on this site.

## How to reach me

You can contact me in the way that feels most comfortable:

- Use the contact form on this page to share what you are dealing with.  
- Call or text using the phone number listed in the site header or footer.  
- Email using the address provided on this page if you prefer to write everything out.

If you are out of state, we can start by phone or video. If you are local to Tucson, we can plan an in-person walkthrough once it makes sense.

Tell me what you are facing with the property. I will listen, outline a simple path from cleanout to closing, and help you decide what the right next step is for you.
