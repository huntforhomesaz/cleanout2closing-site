# When a Property Needs More Than Just a Sale

Facing a family transition or the loss of a loved one is hard enough.  
Figuring out what to do with the property should not add to the burden.

Cleanout2Closing is a Realtor-led estate transition concierge service in Tucson.  
I coordinate everything from cleanout to closing, so you can focus on what matters most.

Primary next step: schedule a simple, no-pressure strategy call so we can talk through your situation and options.

## What situation are you in?

Every property transition is unique. Most families I help see themselves in one of these situations.

### Probate property

Navigating court requirements while managing the house can feel overwhelming.  
I coordinate cleanout, vendor access, and property preparation in alignment with probate timelines and directions from your attorney or fiduciary.

### Trust sale

Trustees carry real responsibilities.  
I support you with vendor coordination, clear documentation, and simple updates so you can show what was done, when, and by whom.

### Inherited property

You have inherited a Tucson home and do not know where to start.  
I help organize next steps, coordinate cleanout and prep, and guide you through the sale from first walk to escrow.

### Senior transition

Moving a parent into assisted living or downsizing is emotional and complex.  
I coordinate move-related vendors, cleanout, and the home sale so family members do not have to manage it alone.

### Family property with multiple decision-makers

Multiple family members and strong opinions can stall progress.  
I act as a neutral coordinator on the property side, keep decisions moving, and make sure everyone has the same information.

### Out-of-state owner

Managing a Tucson property from across the country is exhausting.  
I become your local point of contact, coordinate vendors, protect access to the home, and keep you updated with photos and simple reports.

If you see yourself in any of these, we can use this as a starting point and build the right plan together.

## How I take you from cleanout to closing

This is the simple, four-step journey I follow with most families and professionals.

1. **Talk through your situation and goals**  
   We start with a conversation and, when possible, a property walkthrough.  
   I listen, learn your timelines, and understand any legal or family constraints.

2. **Map out a clear plan and vendors**  
   I outline options for cleanout, repairs, and sale.  
   When you are ready, I coordinate estimates from trusted vendors so you can compare choices before you approve anything.

3. **Coordinate cleanout, prep, and listing**  
   Once you approve the plan, I schedule and oversee vendors for cleanout, basic repairs, landscaping, and photos.  
   I do not operate as a labor crew. Instead, I coordinate and oversee the work while preparing the home for sale as your Realtor.

4. **Guide the sale and keep you updated through escrow**  
   I handle pricing, marketing, and negotiation while keeping you, and your attorney or fiduciary when involved, in the loop.  
   You receive simple updates so you always know where things stand until escrow is complete.

If you want more detail on each step, you can read the full process on the [How It Works](/how-it-works) page.

## Who I help

Cleanout2Closing is built for people who need more than "just list the house."

I most often help:

- Heirs and beneficiaries who have just inherited a Tucson property  
- Trustees and personal representatives who need documentation and clear communication  
- Seniors and adult children managing a move or downsizing  
- Out-of-state owners who cannot be here in person  
- Attorneys, fiduciaries, and Realtors who need a trusted property-side partner

If you are not sure whether your situation fits, that is okay. A short conversation can usually make that clear.

## Why work with me

Cleanout2Closing is led by me, Bradley Hunt.

- Licensed Realtor in Tucson, Arizona  
- Member of the Stratton Group, a top real estate team at Keller Williams  
- U.S. Navy veteran  
- Tucson resident for over 38 years  
- Former owner of Grunt-Work LLC, a successful cleanout and demolition company

This mix of experience means I understand both the real estate side and the practical realities of vendors, equipment, and timelines.  
I know what it takes to get a property from "overwhelming" to "ready for the market" without burning out the family.

My job is to:

- Coordinate and oversee vendors, not to act as the crew  
- Keep you and your attorney or fiduciary informed with simple, written updates  
- Help you understand your options in plain language so you can make decisions you feel good about

Cleanout2Closing does not provide legal or tax advice, and I do not act as an executor, fiduciary, or attorney.  
Your legal and financial decisions stay with you and your professional advisors. I focus on the property and the sale.

## Real families. Real transitions. Real results.

Over the years, families, professionals, and vendors in Tucson have trusted me with:

- Complex cleanouts and property prep for inherited homes  
- Coordinating heavy vendor work without letting details fall through the cracks  
- Keeping communication clear between heirs, trustees, and attorneys

In my previous cleanout and demolition business, and now as a Realtor, I have earned hundreds of five-star reviews across platforms by showing up, communicating clearly, and doing what I said I would do.

On this site, the [Reviews](/reviews) page will share specific stories, before-and-after examples, and proof of results from Tucson and nearby communities.

## Where I currently help families

Cleanout2Closing is based in Tucson and focused on Southern Arizona.

Right now, I most often work in:

- Tucson and greater Tucson  
- Oro Valley and Marana  
- Vail and the Rita Ranch area  
- Green Valley, Sahuarita, and Catalina

The Arizona hub at [/az](/az) explains how coverage will grow over time, starting with Tucson and nearby communities.  
The [Service Areas](/service-areas) page links into the Arizona hub and the Tucson hub, where you can see more detail on how I work in your part of town.

For example, you can learn more about Tucson-specific help on the [/az/tucson](/az/tucson) hub and planned local service pages such as estate cleanout and home sale, senior transition, and out-of-state owner support.

## Common questions

Here are a few answers up front. You can find more on the [Guides](/guides) and [Contact](/contact) pages.

### Do I need to have the house emptied before we talk?

No. Many properties I help with are still full of belongings.  
We can talk through what you want to keep, donate, sell, or discard, then build a cleanout plan around that.

### Can you work with my existing attorney or fiduciary?

Yes. I regularly coordinate with attorneys, fiduciaries, and other professionals on the property side.  
They handle legal and fiduciary decisions. I organize estimates, invoices, and property updates in a way that is easy to add to their files.

### What if the house needs more work than I can afford?

We will walk through options together, from light cleanup and basic repairs to an as-is sale.  
My role is to lay out the pros and cons in plain language and help you match the plan to your comfort level and resources.
