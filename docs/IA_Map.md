## 4. GEO structure

GEO is organized Service-areas overview â†’ State â†’ City â†’ Service.  
Tucson receives full depth in the first six months, with Green Valley now activated as the first retirement-community micro-cluster. Other cities remain reserved for later phases.

Global service-areas overview:

- `/service-areas`  
  Service areas overview â€“ canonical index into all active GEO hubs (Arizona, Tucson, Green Valley, and future markets).

### 4.1 State hub

- `/az`  
  Arizona hub â€“ explains that Cleanout2Closing currently serves Southern Arizona with content focused first on Tucson and Green Valley, and provides a jumping-off point to those city/area hubs.

### 4.2 City hubs (current + reserved)

Active city/area hubs:

- `/az/tucson`  
  Tucson hub â€“ high-level overview of estate transitions, senior moves, and out-of-state owner situations in Tucson, with links into the three main Tucson service pages and related guides.

- `/az/green-valley`  
  Green Valley hub â€“ retirement-community hub focused on senior transitions, estate/inherited sales, and out-of-state owner situations in Green Valley and the Santa Cruz Valley corridor.

Reserved city hubs for future phases:

- `/az/sahuarita`  
- `/az/oro-valley`  
- `/az/vail`  
- `/az/catalina`

Each reserved hub will follow the same pattern as the Tucson and Green Valley hubs once activated.

### 4.3 Tucson service pages (locked pattern)

These are the GEO-prioritized service pages for Tucson:

- `/az/tucson/estate-cleanout-and-home-sale`  
  Estate cleanout and home sale in Tucson â€“ for inherited and probate property situations.

- `/az/tucson/senior-transition-and-home-sale`  
  Senior transition and home sale in Tucson â€“ for assisted living moves and downsizing.

- `/az/tucson/out-of-state-owner-help`  
  Out-of-state owner help in Tucson â€“ for owners, heirs, and trustees managing a Tucson property from another city or state.

Related Tucson-focused guides (live under `/guides` but tightly coupled to the Tucson hub):

- `/guides/inherited-house-tucson-what-to-do`  
- `/guides/pima-county-probate-property-timeline`  
- `/guides/assisted-living-move-tucson-what-happens-to-the-house`

Future city service pages will mirror these patterns where relevant:

- `/az/{city}/estate-cleanout-and-home-sale`  
- `/az/{city}/senior-transition-and-home-sale`  
- `/az/{city}/out-of-state-owner-help` (if demand and scope justify it)

### 4.4 Green Valley service pages (locked pattern)

Green Valley follows a combined senior + estate pattern plus an out-of-state owner focus:

- `/az/green-valley/senior-and-estate-home-sale`  
  Senior transition and estate/inherited home sale in Green Valley â€“ combined GEO service page for assisted living moves, senior downsizing, and estate/trust/inherited sales.

- `/az/green-valley/out-of-state-owner-help`  
  Out-of-state owner help in Green Valley â€“ for heirs, trustees, and snowbirds who live elsewhere but need to clean out, prepare, and sell a Green Valley home.

Future retirement-community markets will reuse this Green Valley pattern unless explicitly changed in a later phase.
