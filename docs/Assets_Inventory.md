Status: Draft v1 complete (Phase 5 â€“ 2025-12-21)  
Location: `content/pages/` in the Cleanout2Closing site repo (exact paths must match IA_Map.md and C2C_MegaSite_MasterPlan.md)  
Source: Phase 5 pillar & core content work (using C2C_MegaSite_MasterPlan.md, IA_Map.md, Page_Templates.md, and Brand_Guardrails.md)  
Usage notes: These files are the authoritative non-GEO core of the mega-site. Copy can be refined (voice, CTAs, internal links), but adding/removing core pages or renaming files requires a new entry in Phase_Decisions_Log.md.


## Notes / Gaps
